This project is designed to enable users to interact with a PDF document in a conversational way. By utilizing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, the project allows you to ask questions about the content of the PDF, and the system provides relevant responses based on the information extracted from the document.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive PDF Chat**: Users can upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content, which the system will process and answer accordingly.
- **Text Extraction**: The project uses advanced PDF parsing techniques to extract the text from the document, ensuring that all relevant information can be accessed.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Integrated with **Generative AI** models, the project interprets and responds to user queries in natural language.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Uses a hybrid approach combining document retrieval and text generation to provide accurate, contextually relevant answers based on the document content.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The core language for implementation.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For deploying language models and fine-tuning them for better comprehension and response generation.
- **PyPDF2 or PDFMiner**: To extract text from PDF files.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application interface, allowing users to upload PDFs and interact with the chat.

### Workflow:
1. **Upload PDF**: Users upload a PDF document through a simple UI.
2. **Text Extraction**: The system extracts the text content from the uploaded PDF.
3. **Query Processing**: Users can ask questions, and the system uses AI-powered models to provide relevant answers from the extracted content.
4. **Response Generation**: The AI model generates responses using context from the PDF to maintain relevance and coherence.

### Purpose:
This tool is designed to simplify the process of retrieving specific information from large PDF documents, such as research papers, manuals, and reports. By interacting with the document in a conversational manner, users can quickly find answers without manually searching through the document.
